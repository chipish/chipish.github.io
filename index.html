              <b><i>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist.
              Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun.
              A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

      <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora,
        and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas.
        From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.
        <br>
       The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a
       natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact
       with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy,
        causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.

      <p> When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake—namely,
        its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the
        Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavík (and Skaftafell).
