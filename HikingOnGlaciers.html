<p><i>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis</i>, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere—at altitudes
  from 60 to more than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field.
  The result is a colorful, dancing light show.
</p>
<p>The first place I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antartica. Luckily, there are much
  more accessible places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats
  to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55 degrees and low light
  pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.
</p>
<p>In the polar latitudes, auraras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not
  necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field
  lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I sggest autumnal equinox
  in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours
  of you location here, or by using a sky guide app.
